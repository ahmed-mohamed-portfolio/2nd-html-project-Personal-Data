Peace be upon you, guys!
I hope you’re all doing well 💜

This is the second assignment: Personal Data.
Before we start solving it, it’s very important to listen carefully to the lecture and read this PDF:

📌 So, what’s required from us? 🧐
✅ We need to create the exact same form (the one at the last link) 💯

❓No hints?
Well, just focus on these points, my friend 😊:

1️⃣ The box with the title “personal data” wasn’t covered in the lecture, but you’ll find it explained in the PDF.
2️⃣ For the select, we’ll create groups — e.g., “Cars” as a main group, and under it different types of cars, and so on.
3️⃣ The Submit button is actually an image, not a regular button 😁
4️⃣ All the inputs should be equal in size and aligned vertically, exactly as shown in the picture. Also, make sure all the colons “:” line up perfectly.
5️⃣ Pay close attention to using for, name, and id — don’t forget, they are very important! They improve Accessibility on our website, and the name attribute is crucial for the backend.
